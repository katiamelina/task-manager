# Desktop Task Mananger Application
> Emily Tacker, Terry Tosh, Julian Vu, Katia Gutierrez and Bigyan Bhandari are 
creating a desktop application where users can keep lists that track the tasks they need to accomplish. Targeted users are
students, people with busy work/personal schedules and people who struggle with time management. We are
creating this app in order to have an increased level of organization, and to learn valuable app developing skills.

[####DELETE QUESTIONS LATER####] -->
 Weâ€™re creating a to-do task management app that can schedule all the tasks/events due in a to-do format,rank their priorities and set the reminder/deadline for each event.
 As college students in junior or senior years, we have several homeworkds/deadlines that are hard to manage sometimes. We'd like make our lifeeasier with this application.
 This application is helpful for everyone, especially people with busy lifestyles, as they have to manage their task/to-do thing everyday.


## Technologies Used
* OpenJDK11 or later version
* Netbeans 12
* Java - version 16.0.1
* Bit Bucket
* Jira
* gradle
* Circle CI


## Features
* User Story: I, Emily, as a college student would like an app where I can keep track of what I need to do. <br />
    * Task Scheduler - Ability to schedule tasks on a given day <br />  
* User Story: I, Bigyan, a working professional, want a to-do app where I can input tasks, deadlines, and their priority so that I do not leave important tasks unfinished. <br />
    * Task Editor - A board that user can remove/add/check tasks <br />
* User Story: I, Terry Tosh, as a software developer, want some sort of prioty status ranking system so that user's can order their to-do list events by priority. <br />
    * Task Priority Ranker - Rank task's priority of the day <br /> 
* User Story: I, Katia Gutierrez, , as a student and full-time worker, would like a to-do list app that allows for categorization so that tasks that deal with school or work or lifestyle can remain in separate, organized, groups. <br />
    * Task Categorizer - Ability to sort/filter task based on expected completion time <br />

Project Status: in progress

## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development. <br />

#### Room for improvement: 
* Configuring UI design. <br />
* The frame that used for add/edit/check/remove task can be polished. <br />


#### To do: 
* Migrating tasks from each Java Swing Panels to a main desktop frame <br />
* Task priority ranking modification will be added. <br />
* Adding every features frame into one main application frame <br />
* Developing a good class design that apply SOLID principles and design patterns to make the code reusable, make classes loosely coupling, 
easy to extend and test.
